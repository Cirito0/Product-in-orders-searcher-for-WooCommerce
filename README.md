# Product-in-orders-searcher-for-WooCommerce
Search an especific product in your WooCommerce orders and shows the ones that are in the "processing" stage

This application was developed in order to help my work mates.
I developed this program because we needed them to know if there was an order in "processing" status that included a certain product WHITOUT accessing to the backend and having
a visual integration.
